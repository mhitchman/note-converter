#+TITLE: Noteconv
Quickly convert between pitch, MIDI number and frequency.
* Building
1. Clone the repository and initialise the submodules =git clone https://github.com/mhitchman/note-converter.git --recursive=
2. Change into the note-converter directory and create a build folder =mkdir build && cd build=
3. =cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install location>=
4. Build with =cmake --build .=
5. Install with =cmake --build . --target install=. The binary =noteconv= will be placed in a bin folder in the install location specified above.
* Usage
Make sure the noteconv binary is on the PATH and run =noteconv= from the command line with the desired options.
Use the =--help= or =-h= flag for information on the supported options.

The utility takes either a pitch name, a MIDI number or a frequency in Hertz and converts that to the other two units and prints out all three.
Specific output units can be selected with fairly opaque switches, check the =--help= text for info.

The following formats are recognised:
** Pitch
Pitch is made up of a note number, an optional a modifier (sharp (s) or flat (f)) and an optional octave number in that order.
Noteconv uses the standard where A4 is 440 Hz and MIDI note number 69.
Notes below octave 0 are just printed without an octave number.
- Example: A sharp in the 4^th octave looks like:
#+BEGIN_SRC
As4
#+END_SRC
** Frequency
Must be a single positive floating point number which is interpreted as Hz.
In the case where the the frequency doesn't exactly match a pitch the utility rounds down to the nearest pitch.
MIDI numbers are always converted accurately to several decimal points even into negative numbers in case that is required.
** MIDI
Takes a single positive integer.
